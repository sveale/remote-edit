Atom package to browse and edit remote files using FTP and SFTP.

## Key features
* Add FTP/SFTP hosts graphically (FTPS not supported at the moment)
* Supports password, key and agent authentication
* Browse files through a select list
* Automatically upload file on save
* Multi-window support (ie. server settings and downloaded files are serialized and accessible across multiple Atom windows)

## Security concerns
 * All information regarding hosts are saved in cleartext. This means that if you select the password authentication scheme and choose not to be prompted at connect, __the password will be stored in cleartext__. This also applies to passphrases if a PKEY is used. Because of this, I recommend using an User Agent with SSH hosts and leaving the passsword/passphrase field blank otherwise.

## Keyboard shortcuts

## Tips and tricks
### SSH auth with password fails
On some sshd configuration (Mac OS X Mavericks), if _PasswordAuthentication_ is not explicitly set to yes, ssh server will not allow non-interactive password authentication. See [this issue](https://github.com/mscdex/ssh2/issues/154) for more in-depth information.

### Agent authentication when using SSH
The package uses [ssh2](https://github.com/mscdex/ssh2) to connect to ssh servers, and also use the default construct in this package to authenticate with an agent.
On Windows, the agent will be set to "pageant", otherwise it assumes a \ix system and uses "process.env['SSH_AUTH_SOCK']" to get the agent.
This can be overridden in the settings.
